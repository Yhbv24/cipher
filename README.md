## Project Goals

The goals of this project are to create a custom module for Drupal. The module is a form input, which takes in three different user inputs: a number, a direction (left or right), and a phrase. The output will take the user's input, and code the phrase based on the other parameters. For example, if a user enters 3, right, and hello, it will output "khoor". That is "hello" shifted three letters to the right.
